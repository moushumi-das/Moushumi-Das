# Project 1: [Bird Image Classifier](https://github.com/moushumi-das/Deep_learning)
For this Data Science project I have used deep learning for image classification.

## Overview 
In this project, I have built a bird classsifier to itentify singing bird from different part of the world. This could be useful for someone who is interested to know about singing birds. They could take picture of a bird and an app could provide the some information about those singing birds. This is the underlying model for building something with those capabilities. 

After minimal tuning, I was able to get the model to predict the bird's type with 93% accuracy. In most of the cases this would meet the need of an end user of the app. In order to get these results I used transfer learning on a CNN trained on resnet34. This created time efficiencies and solid results.

## Data
I have used the following chrome extention to download the data from google images. [Fatkun Batch Download Image](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fatkun-batch-download-ima/nnjjahlikiabnchcpehcpkdeckfgnohf?hl=en)
